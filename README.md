# SWOLE - Linux Distribution for Wearables

## Project End Goal

The end product for this project would be a fully functional linux distribution targeted towards wearable devices such as smartwatches. We would be leveraging many open source technologies for the various components required in the product. 

## Prerequisites

- Programming fundamentals and preferably experience in programming in C/C++. Try to read about good coding practices online.
- Working experience with Linux would be good to have.
- While OS fundamentals aren't expected, they would be great to have since the project will involve core concepts used in operating systems. Try to read about the following topics:
  * Process management, threads and IPC
  * Scheduling
  * Synchronisation
- Curiosity and motivation to learn about new technologies and concepts to use while making design decisions and implementations.


## Resources to Get Started

- [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/11.0/LFS-BOOK-11.0.pdf) 

## Checkpoints

The timeline of the project would be dynamic, hence we focus on checkpoints to be achieved and the expected completion dates would be added as required.

- **Designing Phase**: Make important decisions related to the features to be included in the distribution. Learning about the fundamentals would go hand in hand with this phase.
-  **R&D Phase**: Research about various open source technologies that could be leveraged in our final product so we aren't re-inventing the wheel.
- **Development Phase**: Actual developement of the distro, would go hand in hand with testing and the R&D phase.
